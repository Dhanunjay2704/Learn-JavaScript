## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhanunjay2704/Learn-JavaScript.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to desired phase:**
   ```bash
   cd "PHASE 1"
   ```

3. **Open files in your editor:**
   - Each lesson has an `index.html` file (with DOM/UI) and `index.js` file (logic)
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the interactive examples

---

## 📖 How to Use

- **Sequential Learning:** Start with Phase 1 and progress through each phase
- **Practice:** Each section includes hands-on exercises
- **Review:** Check FINAL_CODE folders for complete implementations
- **Experiment:** Modify the code and see how it affects the output

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Styling (basic)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core programming language
- **Fetch API** - Asynchronous data fetching
- **Web Storage API** - Local and session storage

---
